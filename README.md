# LV2-Gamma
gamma synthesis library

# Gamma is very useful
* It is much more useful to me than Stk really
* Stk is more about music instruments than algorithms

# I am not complaining about Stk
* I use it in the experiments

# there are things that can be improved on Gamma and Stk
* It is not my library so I do not really do it
* It need aligned memory for the allocator
* It would be good to compute frames at a time and it can be optimized by compiler or openmp simd
* I would prefer it use FFTW3 because it is simply what I have all the code for and it already is portable to Cuda like that
